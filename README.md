# TANPle 
**Take A Number Please**

Have you ever approached a customer service desk in a department store to find a ticket dispenser? Once you pulled a ticket from the dispenser, you're free to roam and take care of other business while waiting for support to be free to help.

That's the same concept behind TANPle! A bot facilitated digital ticket experience that will free up technician time while waiting on the phone. This will allow support teams to do a little leg-work, and possibly resolve issues prior to engagement. A much needed improvement over the blind inbound call queue. 

TANPle will categorize issues to 4 main types:
1) Port Turnups
2) CPE Configuration Problems
3) Firmware Upgrades
4) Carrier Testing


Getting Started
------------
With [Dialog Flow's Integrations](https://dialogflow.com/docs/integrations/) this bot can be easily be integrated in many platforms.
There are currently 2 methods implemented: **Cisco Spark**, and **SMS Text messages**. 

### Cisco Spark

In Cisco Spark you will have to search for the TANPle Bot by clicking the '+' sign under people: 

![Getting Started Spark](www/getting_started_spark.png)

Now you are in a one-to-one conversation with the bot.
You should also be able to invite this bot to group chats as well.*

> Group chats with TANPle: You will have to mention @Take for interaction. Creating tickets within group Spaces is difficult.
